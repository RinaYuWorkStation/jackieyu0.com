    <SFont>Jackie Yu is a recent graduate from New York University who majored in Computer Science and Economics, who possesses passion for Technology, as well as Art. She learned in school Algorithms, Data Structure, Computer System Logic, Web Development and Database (SQL/noSQL) management. To see more of her technical skills, check out the resume below. 

    Having grown up in a family where her parensts are both in the Finance Sector, she came to the university studying Economics, but was encouraged to study programming and computer technology by her girl friend when she was a sophomore, and since then she has gained immerse interest in it and excited to explore more into the past and future of technology.

    Demand Paging Simulation - Java
    </MFont><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/RinaYuWorkStation/Java---Demand-Paging-Simulation">github link</a>
    <p>This program simulates demand paging in operating systems. It predicts how many page faults are generated and the average residency time of pages, depending on page size, program/process size, replacement algorithm (FIFO, RANDOM or LRU), and job mix. A driver generates memory reference, and a demand paging simulator decides if the reference causes a page fault. The driver uses round robin scheduling with q references for every process. For more detailed description on the algorithm please click github link</p>
    <p>Demand paging is an important function in computer systems' memory management process. It transfers disk data (in virtual memory) into the RAM (in physical memory) which is easily accessible for processes to use. A page fault occurs when the needed data is not in physical memory, and then the data is retrived from the virtual memory. The design of the demand paging functions is crucial to the time and space effciency of computer systems.  </p>

    Multi-Process Dynamic Resource Allocation Simulation - Java
    </MFont><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/RinaYuWorkStation/Java---Multi-Process-Resource-Allocation">github link</a>
    <p>
        This is a multi-process resource allocation simulation of low level operating system using FIFO and Banker's Algorithm
    </p>
    <p>
        The program uses an optimistic resource manager and the Banker’s algorithm of Dijkstra to complete all requests and avoid deadlocks. The optimistic resource manager satisfies a request if possible, otherwise make it wait. When a release occurs, try to satisfy the pending requests in FIFO order. The Banker's algorithm is better at preventing deadlocks compared to the FIFO.
Input contains: T, # tasks, and R, # resource types and # units of each resource types. Then comes multiple inputs, each representing the next activity of a task. Possible activities: initiate, request, release and terminate. The manager can process one activity (initiate, request or release) for each task in one cycle, but terminate does not require a cycle.
    </p>

    Linker Simulation - Java
    </MFont><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/RinaYuWorkStation/Java---Linker">github link</a>
    <p>
        A linker takes in one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines into a single executable file. This program simulates a two-pass linker.  
    </p>
    <p>
            The Linker processes the input twice, First time, it determines the base address for each module, and the absolute address for each external symbol, storing it in the symbol table. The first module has base address zero, and the next is base address of the last one plus its length. The absolute address for symbol S defined in module M is base address of M plus relative address of S in M. The second time, use the base addresses and the symbol tables to generate the actual output by relocating the relative addresses / resolving external references.

    <p>Jackie worked for New York University, Wasserman Center for Career Development as a Data Analyst on the Assessment Team in 2017-2018. She produces internal and external reports for NYU graduates career information, usage and efficiency reports within the department, and visualization for exisiting reports. She is loved by colleagues for her timely and accurate work, and the results go to deans of NYU and college ranking agencies like Princeton Review. She uses mainly tools like Excel, Tableau and Python. </p>
